check tamrac's website, and look at the diagrams showing the interior compartments of the bag, and how components may be stored, and judge if there's enough space for the particular gear you have.the interior of the bag can be divided into up to six smaller compartments. the layout is designed to accept a body with a zoom lens up to around 8 inches in length attached. while a camera with a long lens will fit in the bag, you'll have arrange things carefully if you want to carry too much else. also this setup does not work well if you have a battery grip attached. one solution is to store the camera and grip with no lens attached. doing this, there is more than adequate space for the body, and three or four lens, and a flash unit. stored vertically, a long lens can be accommodated with no problem. carrying your gear this way, you're not immediately prepared to shoot, as you must take a few moments to assemble the camera.though the bag is really better suited to accommodating the gear

is a zippered fold down compartment with pockets in the front. it would be nice if the pockets had some kind of fasteners. pouches with velco fasteners are on the side of the bag. velcro is an extremely poor design choice. one should not risk putting valuable or heavy items into these pouches. they could easily be lost, or fall out and be broken, should the fasteners fail to hold. this

on a mini-cd (you can also download it from their web site), but i just connected to it directly and configured it through the admin panel. i was delighted to see that the wireless networks came up pre-configured with wpa security and an 8-digit password - many routers are simply &#34;open&#34; when first configured. this encourages users to maintain security. you can set the wireless to wep or even open if you want, but that's generally ill-advised.unlike a certain other brand of router i have tried two examples of (cough - d-link - cough), the tp-link had no trouble negotiating with the ethernet feed of my fios optical network box (the equivalent of a cable modem). some of the configuration features it had that i liked were:- dynamic dns support (though the selection of providers was limited)- separate and easy to understand configuration of 2.4 and 5ghz bands- ability to reserve ip addresses to specific devicessome of the things i didn't like:- only a single display of dhcp clients connected, rather than separating wired from wireless- ip reservation page did not let you select from known connections - you have to type the mac address- no &#34;guest mode&#34; - this is a feature the netgear wndr3700 has that adds a second network which can be configured to give internet access only and not access to your local network. this is great for houseguests and the likethe admin user interface is straightforward, though it uses submenus and some of the pages seemed to duplicate others. for example, there were two different pages where one could enter dns server addresses, and changes to one did not carry over to the other. while each page had pretty good instructions right in the dialog, some of the options were a bit confusing as to how to set them. but what really got me were the pages where i did not notice at first that a frame of the dialog had a scrollbar, and i had to scroll to the right to see additional links, even though there was lots of space for them to show otherwise. a full manual is on the cd as well as on the web site.once set up i tested performance at a distance of about 25 feet through two walls. first i ran tests using the netgear and then the tp-link with the same remote server. the tp-link delivered speeds 30-50% better than the netgear on both the 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands. the netgear is very good about coverage in my house - it has eight (i think) internal patch antennae where the tp-link has three, rather tall stick antennae. i found coverage to be at least as good as the netgear, even about 50-60 feet away and through multiple walls. i could only go by &#34;bars&#34; of signal strength but it seemed to me that the tp-link's signal was stronger on both bands. many dual-band routers are particularly weak on the 5ghz band.as the three antennae suggest, this router supports the &#34;3x&#34; mode of some wireless n adapters for a theoretical maximum bandwidth of 450mbps on the 5ghz band and 300mbps on the 2.4ghz band. add those together and you get the &#34;750&#34; emblazoned on the router. the spec sheet i got indicates tested speeds of 241mbps and 135mbps respectively, still not shabby. the ethernet ports are all gigabit, and the test indicates lan-wan speeds as much as 935mbps. that's fast.the tl-wdr4300 has two usb 2.0 ports on back. these can connect to usb storage or to a usb printer. for storage the router will make the storage available as a network share, or you can enable an ftp server that can, if you wish, be accessed from the internet. (the default is off.) unfortunately, only standard ftp is supported, not sftp over ssh, so your login information (you can set a username/password pair) is sent unencrypted. my advice is to not use this feature over the internet.i did not test the print server, as my printer is already network-enabled. for windows there is a utility you install that, if i understand correctly, pretends to be a usb port and relays information to and from your usb printer. scanners are also supported.i did test the dlna media server. you can specify up to six folders on the usb storage to serve and it will relay audio, video and photos to dlna clients on your local network. i fired up goodplayer on my ipad and played a movie from a usb hard disk - it worked beautifully. the promotional material claims that it can serve media over the internet, but i think this is incorrect - there's no setting to enable/disable it and no instructions for how you would access the media from outside your local network. i will verify this with tp-link support and update this review when i learn more. (edit: tp-link confirmed that media serving is local network only.)tp-link's documentation takes the unusual step of saying that one can install and run the freeware dd-wrt router software on some of its routers. i checked at the dd-wrt web site and while the wdr4300 is not yet officially supported, there is a beta version that at least partially works, and development for the wdr4300 is proceeding. according to the spec sheet tp-link included, the wdr4300 has an atheros chipset that runs at 560mhz, 128mb of ram and 8mb of flash - these are rather high values for routers in this price range and suggests great performance and resistance to locking up after being on a long time (a problem i have seen with other routers.)lastly, as i do for most products i test, i looked at power consumption. for a device you'll leave on all the time, this can matter. i was pleased to see that the wdr4300 maxed out at 4 watts with wireless on, where the older netgear router was averaging 6-7 watts. excellent.i give the tp-link tl-wdr4300 4.7 stars -

B002AZ3D3E,"[u'a great concept let down by a few design flaws.my intent for buying a new alarm clock was two-fold:1) to enable me to set an alarm which would wake me, without disturbing others2) to have a way to dim the clock so it would not disturb my sleep with too much light in the room.having this connect to an ipod nano was a bonus.the first thing that impressed me from the specs on this alarm clock was the bed shaker.  now, take note, this says bed shaker - and it truly is.  anyone sleeping on the same matress will feel their skull vibrating almost as much as yours, even when you place the vibrating disc under your pillow.  9/10 points for effort - 4/10 points for implementationthe second thing that persuaded me to this model was that it appeared, from reading through the reviews that the brightness on the clock was settable from 0 (no backlight) to 9 (bright enough to read a book by).  this seemed great as this would allow me to have the backlight off for sleeping and adjust it if/when i needed to read the clock... however, the implementation of this is a fatal flaw for me with this product.  let me explain in detail:a) the brightness change requires you to set a new overall brightness level; so if you are at 0 you click the dimmer/snooze button and it goes to 1.  to turn the light off you have to click the button another 9 times to cycle back to 0.  this is awkward, though is way surpassed by the loud clicking made by the cheap switch which wakes anyone else not wearing earplugs...b) insult is added to injury with the design of the dimmer/snooze button.  imagine you\'re sleeping with the backlight off (dimmer 0) and the alarm occurs - you hit the button to increase the brightness, but it\'s a joint-function dimmer/snooze button... so, the alarm snoozes - and no matter how many times you hit the dimmer/snooze button again, to turn the brightness up to see the time, nothing happens.  it appears the the clock is in ""alarm mode"".  the only way to see the clock is to fumble for the alarm off button, turn off the alarm permanently and then hit the dimmer/snooze button again to now increase the backlight on the clock to level 1.i know, and apologise, if this appears like a rant - and maybe my unit is faulty as the dimmer 1 setting is incredibly bright and disturbing to sleep.on the brighter side.  the ipod functionality works well, even on the new ipod nanos, and the speakers are ok - definitely not hi-fi, but for a bedside table to listen to music whilst reading a book, they are adequate.anyway, please take the review as is, and if you we looking to an alarm clock with similiar prerequisites steer clear of this one.  i wish/hope that these flaws are corrected and welcome any feedback to highlight better alternatives.hope this helps,', u""the first thing that impressed me from the specs on this alarm clock was the bed shaker. now, take note, this says bed shaker - and it truly is. anyone sleeping on the same matress will feel their skull vibrating almost as much as yours, even when you place the vibrating disc under your pillow. 9/10 points for effort - 4/10 points for implementationthe second thing that persuaded me to this model was that it appeared, from reading through the reviews that the brightness on the clock was settable from 0 (no backlight) to 9 (bright enough to read a book by). this seemed great as this would allow me to have the backlight off for sleeping and adjust it if/when i needed to read the clock... however, the implementation of this is a fatal flaw for me with this product. let me explain in detail:a) the brightness change requires you to set a new overall brightness level;

 (pass through) these units stay in standby mode as long as unit is connected to wall outlet.cd changer, tape deck, powered sub-woofer, a/v receiver (amp delay)- these units are off when power is set to off.power, performance, video and sound so far have been flawless.three points to remember:as another reviewer mentioned the power lights on the front ( 3 green, one blue) are always on, cannot be dimmed, and may be a distraction in a dark room when watching a movie for example. mine is inside a cabinet behind a glass door, so this is not an issue for me personally.secondly, all the outlets are side by side, that means that transformer style plugs will not fit, or will block adjacent outlets when used. my new cable box has one such power cable, so i had to plug that in separately with an additional ""in wall"" surge protector, no big deal really, the coax cable to the cable box is still routed through the main unit, so i have kind of double protection on the cable box.thirdly, this is manual on/off - i originally configured my harmony remote to turn the unit on with each activity, which of course it did not, as the unit has no remote control capability.i\'m not saying that other surge protectors are worthless, anything is better than plugging straight into the wall outlet, but when you consider that some high end trailing style surge protectors can cost over $50, this is worth it for aesthetic value, as well as clearing up trailing wires. it also gives you that extra layer of av filtering for better sound and visual reproduction.a small investment really, for looks, style, performance and protection. 5 stars']"

 eh!  keyboards are the proverbial dime a dozen these days.  big whoop.  but my trackman!  i was frozen in terror.  do they still make trackballs?  or have mice totally won over?  or are they all ambidextrous now with the ball in the middle to appease lefties?

the speed difference in sequential write (12.1 vs 4.6 mb/s) and 512kb random write (8.3 vs .61 mb/s). since the rezound is capable of capturing 1080p video, i wanted something a bit baster then what the sandisk was offering.  the only area the samsung was slower was the random 4kb write area, but since rezound includes 10gb internal sd for use, i use that for most of the apps and dedicated the add on microsd to video, photo and music which would be larger files and thus benefit from the card.  also this way i'm not worried about corruption due to small file performance as mentioned when you look up class 10 card usage in an android phone.just to add a little more info, i just ran sd tool on the phone and got the ffwrite 8.6 mb/sread 19.3 mb/sso the phone is able to use the extra speed being a newer generation phone."", u""pros:my card came today nicely packaged in one of those indestructible containers from the manufacturer.  after destroying the package i popped in in my samsung galaxy player 5.0 and it works just fine.  when in the player it only gets around 5 mbps write and about 15 read during actual transfers.  i was thinking i got a dud until i popped it into the included adapter and plugged it into my laptop.  in there i was getting the advertised speeds of 10-12 mbs write and 22-24 mbs read when actually transferring files.  i downloaded crystal mark [...] and ran it through 3 tests and they all passed with similar speeds.cons:in my mobile device it doesn't perform at advertised speeds, not sure if its an issue with my device or usb, but it does perform when plugged directly into the sd adapter on my laptop.other thoughts:my order was fulfilled through amazon and was definetly new and authentic.  its amazing that there is 32gbs in such a tiny chip.here are my benchmarks.  the second is in my galaxy player with it plugged into a usb 3.0 port on my laptop so a little faster.-----------------------------------------------------------------------crystaldiskmark 3.0.1 x64 (c) 2007-2010 hiyohiyocrystal dew world :

if you do, it will squish outside the edge of the chip, get on your motherboard, the cpu locking mechanism, your hands, etc... it makes a real mess. start with a small amount and add more if necessary. the idea here is to get a thin, even layer across the entire chip surface. a toothpick actually work's really well at spreading the paste around. you should not be able to see any part of the metal of the chip when you're done. less is more in this instance; many people think they need to slather this stuff onto the chip, but trust me that does nothing but make a mess.4. install your heat sink and fan assembly. i recommend getting an aftermarket heat sink as those provided by intel are notoriously poor. zalman makes some great ones. do not buy on that uses push pins to lock in place. you want one with screws and mounting bracket so that it is very securely attached to the motherboard and in turn, your cpu. this is probably equally important to applying the thermal compound correctly, because all the compound in the world won't help you if the heatsink isn't making solid contact with the chip's surface.if you follow those steps, you will see a massive improvement in your core temps. just remember that heat dissipation is achieved by the fans in your case and heatsinks, not the compound itelf. the compound simply allows for a much better transfer for heat from chip-->heatsink. i swear by arctic silver, and i promise you it works if you use it correctly."", u""arctic silver 5 is the best thermal compound on the market. there are other types that might be better for specific purposes (arctic c&eacute;ramique for example), but for cooling a cpu, this is the best. i've used it extensively for quite a few computer builds as well as a few 'special projects' like replacing the thermal compound on an asus formula x48 mother board's northbridge and southbridge heatsinks.the results are always a 4-10c drop in cpu temperatures under load. you will not notice a huge difference at idle. the real gains in heat dissipation come when the cpu is being pushed. also, don't trust the board makers proprietary software to tell you what your temperatures are; download a good program like realtemp 2.41 or everest for free (use google to find them). either will give you more accurate numbers than asus pc probe, or whatever software your board manufacturer supplies.there are some saying arctic silver 5 didn't lower their temperatures. that is almost certainly because they're using it incorrectly, which i can understand since the instructions provided are minimally useful. so for those of you who are not familiar with applying thermal paste, here is the process:1. remove the old thermal compound. this is accomplished by using isopropyl alcohol to dissolve and loosen the old thermal paste. i recommend purchasing anarcticlean kit. for minimal cost it will give you the compound remover, as well as an excellent surface preparer. apply a several drops of the cleaner to the top of the chip and let it soak for 20-30 seconds. you might have to reapply more drops of cleaner again depending on how much thermal compound was present on the chip to begin with. wipe all the waste off with a lintless cloth or cotton swabs.2. apply a surface cleaner. you can use more alcohol, or the surface preparer that comes in the arctic silver kit. make sure there are no traces of the old compound: you can tell that the surface is perfectly clean when you can wipe it with a new q-tip and it comes away pure white.3. apply arctic silver 5. do not use too much!

B00C46K0X0,"[u'i grabbed thissony16gb sdhc uhs-1 class 10 memory card (sf16ux/tqn)during an amazon gold box deal. prior to this purchase, i already own many class-10 cards sold under different brand names, including sandisk, hp, transcend, pny, etc. so i wanted to see how this sony card stacks up against other brands.i tested this card using thetranscend rdf5 usb 3.0 card readerconnected to my computer\'s usb 2.0 port. the following is a summary of sequential write speeds (as reported by ""crystaldiskmark 3.01"") for my class-10 sdhc cards, listed from fastest to slowest:-hp class-10 cg790a: 29.7mb/s-sony uhs sf16ux/tqn(this product): 29.1mb/s &lt;-- [see update below]-transcend uhs ts32gsdhc10u1e: 29.0mb/s-transcend class-10 ts16gsdhc10e: 16.7mb/s-sandisk ultra class-10 dsdu-032g-affp: 12.7mb/s-toshiba class-10 thnsh032gtrt: 12.0mb/s(see the comparison chart i uploaded to \'customer images\' section)to qualify as a \'class-10\', a sd card only has to sustain sequential-write speed of 10mb per second. as can be seem from the above, the fastest three cards (hp, sony and transcend) all exceed this requirement by nearly 3x. one thing i noticed is that they have essentially the same read/write speed, which suggests the top speed is limited by the usb 2.0 port of my computer.of course, the real benchmark needs to be done in the actual application. for that, i inserted each card in my canon rebel t1i dslr camera, set it to save both raw and jpeg formats, then took 10 consecutive shots in burst mode. the sony card wins this round \'by a nose\'. it took only 15.6 sec to save all 250mb of data in my camera, the transcend and hp cards are close behind, finishing in 16.2 and 16.7 sec, respectively. in contrast, the sandisk ultra took much longer at 23.8s, even though it also qualifies as a class-10.it should be noted that my dslr camera is fairly old (2009), so it is unable to take full advantage of uhs-1 cards. if you have a modern high-end dslr, the sony card should perform even faster. but the speed difference will only be noticeable if you save your image files in raw format (~25mb each) and also shoot in burst mode. for most people who save in jpeg format (~5mb each), they will most likely never notice any slow down caused by memory card.bottom line:this sony uhs1 sdhc card is among the fastest class-10/uhs-1 cards i have ever tested. unfortunately, since i don\'t have an usb 3.0 port, i am unable to unlock its full potential. i still consider it a great value, especially at the deal price i paid (around $1 per gb). but in case this item is not on sale, you may want to consider either the transcend uhs or hp class-10 card, which are just as fast when used in usb 2.0 mode.other notes:- the capacity of this \'16gb\' sony card, as reported by my computer, is only 15.0gb. this is actually normal because computer people count one gig as ""2 to the power 30"", which is 7.3% larger than one billion. so 15.0gb translates to over 16.1 billion bytes, which is \'16gb\' according to marketing people.- my card has ""made in taiwan"" printed on the back.- the card comes without any storage cases.- on the package there is an offer to download a free ""memory card file rescue"" program from sony web site. i don\'t see it as very useful since it allegedly does not work with non-sony memory cards.[update on dec 26, 2013]i

card only has to sustain sequential-write speed of 10mb per second. as can be seem from the above, the fastest three cards (hp, sony and transcend) all exceed this requirement by nearly 3x. one thing i noticed is that they have essentially the same read/write speed, which suggests the top speed is limited by the usb 2.0 port of my computer.of course, the real benchmark needs to be done in the actual application. for that, i inserted each card in my canon rebel t1i dslr camera, set it to save both raw and jpeg formats, then took 10 consecutive shots in burst mode. the sony card wins this round 'by a nose'. it took only 15.6 sec to save all 250mb of data in my camera, the transcend and hp cards are close behind, finishing in 16.2 and 16.7 sec, respectively. in contrast, the sandisk ultra took much longer at 23.8s, even though it also qualifies as a class-10.it should be noted that my dslr camera is fairly old (2009), so it is unable to take full advantage of uhs-1 cards. if you have a modern high-end dslr, the sony card should perform even faster. but the speed difference will only be noticeable if you save your image files in raw format (~25mb each) and also shoot in burst mode. for most people who save in jpeg format (~5mb each), they will most likely never notice any slow down caused by memory card.bottom line:this sony uhs1 sdhc card is among the fastest class-10/uhs-1 cards i have ever tested. unfortunately, since i don't have an usb 3.0 port, i am unable to unlock its full potential. i still consider it a great value, especially at the deal price i paid (around $1 per gb). but in case this item is not on sale, you may want to consider either the transcend uhs or hp class-10 card, which are just as fast when used in usb 2.0 mode.other notes:- the capacity of this '16gb' sony card, as reported by my computer, is only 15.0gb. this is actually normal because computer people count one gig as &#34;2 to the power 30&#34;, which is 7.3% larger than one billion. so 15.0gb translates to over 16.1 billion bytes, which is '16gb' according to marketing people.- my card has &#34;made in taiwan&#34; printed on the back.- the card comes without any storage cases.i would rate this product a 5 star out of 5.""]"

B005DIBHA6,"[u'i purchased this garmin to get a new version of a gps.  i had a tom tom xxl which i fully expect to continue to use.  as far as i can tell not alot of difference in the maping source for programing.  i like the favorties function on my tom tom better, but you can still do the same on the garmin, but it is a little confusing.  now the pluses for the garmin.  i have traveled over a mile, before my tom tom finds a satailite. one night recently i went 20 miles with out it working so i had to turn the xxl of and back on to get it to work, more than once.  the garmin is connect in seconds, much better.  i really like the traffic mode on the garmin and the factory cable that came with the unit works great, so no need for an upgrade.  wow,  want to find a place to eat.  its a piece of cake with the garmin.  so that and other find features are far superior on the garmin.  the touch screen works better than my tom tom.  much more sensitive too.  i do not find my self smacking the screen so to speack as i do on the tom tom to get it to go.  anyway, i am keeping them both in my motorhome when i travel, and both units split in to both of our cars when not traveling.  i give the garmin a  ++  over the tom tom, which  is a good unit also.recently i had a free programing upgrade for my tom tom.  it has worked sense then, flawlessly.  my wife and i took a 2000 mile trip this spring.  the tom tom maping kept us on the the correct roads.  the garmin was definetly not as accurate.  i ran them both in my motorhome.  if i was going to use only one unit, becuase of road accuracy,  it would be the tom tom that i kept.  the garmin more than once wanted to send down some dirt road out in the middle of nowhere.  good thing we did not following it.  :)', u'i am directionally challenged.  for me a gps is indispensable .  i have been on  what seems like a lifetime search for a gps that i am happy with, and have yet to find one that i really like.update - after having this one yearthe traffic is now really great - usually warns ahead that there is traffic on the route - the length and nature of the delay is now spot on.  blows the tom-tom out of the water and is as good as local traffic cam.  updates better.  maps better.  routing better.i have narrowed the choice  between garmin and tom tom.  here, i thought it would be useful to detail side by side details of comparable models (below) although much of the issues apply to more than one of the models and are really applicable to the brand.tomtom via 1505tm 5-inch gps navigator with lifetime traffic & maps vs garmin n&uuml;vi 2555lmt 5-inch portable gps navigator with lifetime maps and traffic.navigation is the key - i really don\'t care if i can turn my car icon into a batman car.  garmin now wins  every bad route is costly to me, especially in traffic, so even a small gain in route accuracy is important.  the exit numbers and exact signage is more often wrong on the tom tom even after many updates.the maps are more accurate in the nuvi.  exits numbers and signage is often wrong on the tom tom.  the nuvi hasn\'t been wrong yet.  i update the maps on both regularly and tom tom still has wrong exits numbers on major highway and bridge exits, despite ""community"" updates. however, the  nuvi used to choose odd routes (when tested in areas that i am familiar with) more often then the tom tom.  no more - now it actually choses the faster route (if that is how i set up)  both are better than nothing in unfamiliar areas, but neither are super. oddly, even though the nuvi has a complete and accurate map of the roads inside my campus complex (which the tom tom does not) it can\'t find my building address when i am in the parking lot behind the building and wants to send me some blocks backward to get on a main road.  the tom tom doesn\'t show the small internal roads, but directs me correctly.generally, tom tom\'s version of lane guidance and junction view gives your more time.  i tested them both at the same difficult junction (enter a highway and immediately have to cross  2 lanes of a merging highway to get off the exit).  the nuvi was telling me to get into the right lane when i was already on the exit ramp and didn\'t give me the junction view until then.  the tom tom tells me in enough time to do that properly.  tom tom flashes to full screen ""junction view""  (lane assist) which shows you which lane to be in and what exit your are looking for.  the nuvi version is more accurate, the exit signs are more often correct and  look like the actual sign you see and the junction is also more accurate and real world. however it is half screen.  this is where the nuvi stil fails - i need more time people.on both the traffic used to be very hit and miss.  tomtom now falls way behind here and garmin is superior.  in the last 6 months it has been spot on almost every time.  updates are a little faster on the nuvi and it doesn\'t try to take me through manhattan  or congested side routes as often. in side by side tests, the nuvi wins here by far (in ny and nj and ct).satellite acquisition is much faster on the nuvi.  tom tom can take up to 5 min.  usually takes at least 1-2 min.  nuvi takes under 30 sec - 1 min.reliabliltiy is better on the nuvi.  all my tom toms have had  issues with car  charging and not turning on.  nuvi has battery charge bar  and i have never had problems with this one (or my other garmins_) turning on.  this is an  obvious deal breaker for a gps.the user interface is probably a matter of taste.  the tom tom is less cluttered and allows you access most of what you could need while driving (volume, brightness) without having to go through many screens from a central info bar.  this is both more convenient and safer.finding addresses is quicker and more intuitive on the tom tom.  the nuvi almost insists on trying to find matches for the name of your street in the whole us.  you can specific a state, but it requires a fairly unwieldy set of steps to do this and this interface is buggy.  just hope you don\'t have to find an oak st or  main st or be prepared to scroll. saving favorites is one touch on the tom tom and a bit of a pain on the nuvi.can you say ""zip codes"" people?  tom tom wins out here, but this should be a default option on any gps with us maps.the touchscreen is much more responsive on the nuvi.  the tom toms have to really been pushed - sometimes enough so that you have to take it off the mount.build quality is better on the nuvi.points of interest are bad on both.  i tried finding a gas station in a familiar area where i knew what the answers should be.  both missed the nearest gas station (5 blocks away and on the same street).  they did get stations within 2 miles (not exactly the same list either, how odd).both have text to speech for the default voices.  garmin is better here - and it shows the name of the street/highway you are aiming for next in a green bar on top of the screen.  this is immensely helpful.  both make oddly silly mistakes (tom tom insists on ""branch"" instead of ""bridge"" and nuvi says ""doctor"" instead of ""drive"").the web interface is far superior on the nuvi.  initial map ""updates"" take forever on both (about 2-4 hrs).  however, the nuvi interface works.  the tom tom interface is very buggy, frustrating and often requires many, many restarts.neither one lets you customize the route at all in any meaningful way.  i often know part of the way, but not necessarily the whole route.  these are pretty useless at letting you choose any alternate portion of the route - even using a ""via"" point.  frankly, google is better for this, and both stink at imports.i used to think there wasn\'t a  clear winner here, but recent garmin updates have made it the clear winner in my opinion.  maybe someone from these companies read the review.']"

B007R8U5R6,"[u""this is my first denon and i am happy with this unit! it replaces an pioneer elite  7.1 channel home theater receiver. because of its network capabilities and 3-d, it does so much more than just provide a central hub for all your audio equipment. the first thing you'll want to do is update the firmware. connect the denon to your tv with an hdmi cable so you see what's going on. then connect a network cable to the back to the unit. it takes about 20 minutes to finish.the onscreen interface is straightforward and will take you through all the setup, like network settings, speaker configuration, etc. a qsg (quickstart guide) is included. it's on a cd or can be downloaded from denon's website. i appreciate having them in electronic format since they don't take up space. the manual is very detailed and comprehensive, totaling 150+ pages. all the ports are clearly labeled and probably the only thing you'll need to refer to is the audyssey calibration setup and listening positions so you can get the best performance out of your speakers, as each user's room configuration is unique. the audyssey calibration unit also works with the onkyo and other avr's.there are 5 hdmi inputs, which ought to be enough for almost everybody. need more that that and you can buy an hdmi switcher, 3 to1 switch. the front has an additional 6th hdmi port, and there are a multitude of additional legacy analog ports as well as one optical port. the denon connects to siriusxm, pandora, and spotify if you have an account with these services. strangely, there's also a flickr browser that lets you look at photographs. you can also listen to fm and numerous internet radio stations. there are, without exaggeration, over a thousand stations divided into dozens upon dozens of genres and sub-genres.the feature that i am really pleased with, however, is airplay compatibility and ability to control the denon via my smartphone. you can stream music directly from your iphone or ipod touch straight to the denon (i'm on a 4s). no need for a usb cable. listening to some goldfrapp for the first time through the denon, i was pleasantly surprised by the quality. the sound is fantastic coming out of the speakers. i've never heard my music sound this good before, hearing nuances and sounds i never did through my headphones.the best part is that you can control the denon from another room through the denon remote app (search for &#34;denon app&#34; in app store). you don't need to point the iphone at the avr. as long as your phone is within range of your wifi network, you'll be able to communicate with the denon. i love the freedom this allows me. my iphone has steadily taken over my life, becoming the central hub for entertainment, work, communications, and organizing my life in general. with airplay, i don't need to tie up my phone being a jukebox or fumble with the included remote. while well-designed and not a mishmash of buttons, nothing beats the intuitiveness of a touchscreen display and the laziness of surfing from a bed or sofa in the next room. the app is much more convenient than the included remote, particularly when looking for internet radio. say, if i'm listening to music in bed and it's dark. for one thing, you don't need to have the tv on to see the menu or look at the avr's led display! it's right in the palm of your hands. airplay would also be very handy for parties. guests don't even need to download the app and there's no complicated setup or bluetooth pairing like i had to do with some cars i've ridden in. just give your guests your wifi password and the airplay compatible device should just appear as an output option.i can't think of anything bad to say about this denon. the only thing i don't like is the door flap for the front inputs. push it on the right side and it pops out, exposing jacks for hdmi, usb, rca plugs, and the setup mic. it is not a captive/spring-loaded door, so it could potentially get lost quite easily. again, not a big deal since i'll never use these ports.all in all, i love this avr, with airplay and smartphone remote (available for android as well) being the best features. it sometimes crashes, but i'm willing to tolerate it for now. if you don't need all the controls (for internet radio, zones), you can just use the default music player on iphone and just play your playlist through the denon via airplay. pushing airplay will turn the denon on automatically. you do have to manually turn it off though.. or wait til the auto power-off timer kicks in."", u'this is my first denon and boy, am i happy with this unit! it replaces an olderonkyo tx-sr606 7.1 channel home theater receiver (black)that was my audio workhorse for the last 4 years. because of its network capabilities, it does so much more than just provide a central hub for all your audio equipment. the first thing you\'ll want to do is update the firmware. connect the denon to your tv with an hdmi cable so you see what\'s going on. then connect a network cable to the back to the unit. it takes about 30 minutes to finish, so go take a shower or talk to your cat until then.the onscreen interface is fairly bland, but it\'s straightforward and will take you through all the setup, like network settings, speaker configuration, etc. a qsg (quickstart guide) is included, but a printed manual is not. it\'s on a cd or can be downloaded from denon\'s website. i\'m not one of those people that misses printed manuals. i appreciate having them in electronic format since they don\'t take up space. the manual is very detailed and comprehensive, totaling 150+ pages. you won\'t need it if you\'ve set up an avr before, however. all the ports are clearly labeled and probably the only thing you\'ll need to refer to is the audyssey calibration setup and listening positions so you can get the best performance out of your speakers, as each user\'s room configuration is unique. the audyssey calibration unit also works with the onkyo and other avr\'s. i do wish the terminal screws were color-coded though, but this is no big deal. my onkyo, for example, has a different color for each speaker terminal, to match the wires so i don\'t have to keep looking back and forth to identify what\'s what.there are 5 hdmi inputs, which ought to be enough for almost everybody. i have a ps3, xbox360, blu-ray player,western digital wd tv live media player, and cable, which fills out the full complement of ports. need more that that and you can buy an hdmi switcher, 3to1 switch. the front has an additional 6th hdmi port, and there are a multitude of additional legacy analog ports as well as one optical port. the denon connects to siriusxm, pandora, and spotify if you have an account with these services. strangely, there\'s also a flickr browser that lets you look at photographs. none of these interest me (pandora i stopped using due to the lack of variety, and the others, i don\'t want to pay for) and i wish that blip.fm was also included in the mix. you can also listen to fm and numerous internet radio stations. there are, without exaggeration, over a thousand stations divided into dozens upon dozens of genres and sub-genres. some of them may not always be reachable because they are being streamed from all over the world or due to network problems. i tried listening to some stations from china, hk, germany, japan, and denmark as a random test. most of the ones from china didn\'t load, but quality is quite good for all the ones that did. it\'s not just music. there are news stations, sports, weather, religion, podcasts.. a whole random assortment of stuff. this is great for users looking to expand their horizons a bit and are wildly diverse. you can bookmark stations for later.the feature that i am really pleased with, however, is airplay compatibility and ability to control the denon via my smartphone. you can stream music directly from your iphone or ipod touch straight to the denon (i\'m on a 4s). no need for a usb cable. listening to somegoldfrappfor the first time through the denon, i was pleasantly surprised by the quality. the sound is fantastic coming out of the speakers. i\'ve never heard my music sound this good before, hearing nuances and sounds i never did through my headphones.the best part is that you can control the denon from another room through the denon remote app (search for ""denon app"" in app store). you don\'t need to point the iphone at the avr. as long as your phone is within range of your wifi network, you\'ll be able to communicate with the denon. i love the freedom this allows me. my iphone has steadily taken over my life, becoming the central hub for entertainment, work, communications, and organizing my life in general. with airplay, i don\'t need to tie up my phone being a jukebox or fumble with the included remote. while well-designed and not a mishmash of buttons, nothing beats the intuitiveness of a touchscreen display and the laziness of surfing from a bed or sofa in the next room. the app is much more convenient than the included remote, particularly when looking for internet radio. say, if i\'m listening to music in bed and it\'s dark. for one thing, you don\'t need to have the tv on to see the menu or look at the avr\'s led display!

B0097BEF1S,"[u'the ipod touch 5th generation has come a long way since the launch of the first generation ipod a few years go. there are several features that i love about this new touch. my quick impressions so far after having used it for just under a week.form factor - the touch is thinner than iphone 5 though still has the same 4-inch retina display. the overall experience is significantly better using this device compared to the touch 4. i was pretty happy with my touch 4, but now looking at it after playing with the touch 5, it just seems small! the 5 is thinner and lighter than even the iphone 5. very slick.body - the back is anodized aluminum finish in amazing colors. the matte finish makes it less scratch-prone (at least so far it seems that way) compared to the steel-backed touch 4. the body is slightly more rectangular and less curved than the 4, making it easier to use the side volume buttons. i honestly don\'t think a case is necessary for this device given its beautiful colors and fairly scratch-resistant body, but that again would be entirely a personal decision. some folks are prone to dropping devices in which case a case is a must. my 2 cents - a transparent case would probably be best which at least allows the beauty of the device to come through. putting on a thick black case on this would be doing it severe injustice!camera - the camera is in my opinion one of the best features of the touch. the touch has a 5mp camera, which i think is the same as the iphone though i could be wrong on this. it gives 1080p recording in this slick device, makes me think back of the loaded camcorders we carried and converted tapes to dvds, and that wasn\'t so long ago! the camera, same as the iphone camera, gives the panoramic option which lets you capture a pretty wide angle shot. i tried this feature only in the house, but due to different lighting in the different areas that i was shooting, the picture didn\'t come out so well. i\'m sure if taken with correct lighting or outdoors, the panoramic pictures would be spectacular. i wonder if the camera is meant to be the main feature of the touch that apple wants to push, given that they included a hand strap with the touch, just like most cameras come with.a5 processor - the difference in speed because of the a5 processor is quite noticeable, for the better. it makes the device much faster - for apps, loading videos, etc. for the few apps that i use often, the speed is remarkable.earbuds - i don\'t use the apple earphones because they have been uncomfortable for me personally. i tried the new earbuds and these fit much better. sound quality maybe just about the same, at least i didn\'t notice any significant difference. i\'m happy using my bose or sony headphones with the touch. the speaker on the ipod is decent for light listening or watching videos. it\'s really not meant to give surround sound, but the speakers do their job fine.connector - the lightning connector is probably better for charging speeds and data transfer (i guess), but the only good thing that i find about this is that the cable can be inserted either way into the touch. unlike the previous 30-pin connector that could only be inserted one way up. one thing to note - and this might have just been me but i did see some reviews earlier to this effect - the usb end of the adapter is probably the same as all usbs. but, for some reason, when i plugged it in to my car charger, it got stuck in it. i struggled for a good 5 minutes to get it out. i had no problems with my 30-pin connector cable with this charger. i later read reviews for the car charger and other folks had mentioned the same thing. not sure what the issue was, maybe just a few isolated events. but for now i am not using any non-apple approved charger, even if it is just a usb charger. another problem i have faced is that when i connect the ipod to the usb jack in my car, there are times when the sound comes through the ipod instead of the car speakers. the ipod is connected and shows ""accessory connected"". i then have to unlplug the device and plug it back in, and then it works fine. this has happened 2-3 times over the past few days. i\'m not sure if this has to do with the lightning cable or the car\'s usb port.software - it runs on ios6 and the speed is amazing. note that it doesn\'t have google maps which i sorely miss, but that\'s an issue more with ios6 rather than the ouch itself. hopefully apple\'s maps will get better :) it has built-in siri but i don\'t use siri myself so can\'t comment on that.it\'s hard to compare this with the iphone because this is not a phone, though you can download skype or vonage mobile and use these apps to turn the touch into a makeshift phone. i guess it could be compared to other tablets which do pretty much the same thing as the touch for the most part. a lot of the tablets are cheaper in price, though have less storage capacity and can\'t be used so efficiently as a camera, or an mp3 player while working out.all in all i am very impressed and pleased with the touch 5 so far. whether to buy or upgrade to this device is entirely a personal decision depending on what you\'re looking for.', u'the ipod touch 5th generation has come a long way since the launch of the first generation ipod a few years go. there are several features that i love about this new touch. my quick impressions so far after having used it for just under a week.form factor - the touch is thinner than iphone 5 though still has the same 4-inch retina display. the overall experience is significantly better using this device compared to the touch 4. i was pretty happy with my touch 4, but now looking at it after playing with the touch 5, it just seems small!

B000FTLOL0,"[u'i have shared the same experience as the most helpful reviews here: this is a pain to install when you want to configure this extender to be secure (so strangers can\'t mooch off of your internet or worse). on the other hand, once you have it set up, it works like a charm.it\'s possible, but prepare to burn an hour or three. i would like to add some instructional steps, which are a variation of the very helpful ones already present here on amazon.dummies guide on how to set up the extender with security turned on:1. completely ignore the instruction sheet that comes with the product. at first, i tried following it stubbornly despite reading these amazon reviews, and i found that it is an embarrassment. shame on you belkin, for giving us so much unnecessary grief.2. find a computer in your home to use for this setup. any computer (that isn\'t vista) will do.3. if this computer happens to be plugged into your router (i\'m not talking about not the extender), unplug it from the router. if this computer happens to have a wireless connection, disable the wireless connection.4. plug in the power cord for the extender into the wall, then connect an ethernet cord (looks like a fat telephone cord) into the back of the extender, then stick the other end into your computer. the ""lan"" light will now light up. just in case you\'re concerned, you can ignore the red ""search"" light that may blink.5. install the ""belkin range extender utility"" onto this computer. the installation cd will place a program in your start->programs menu once you run the install.6. go to start->settings->network connections. at this point the only enabled network connection should be local area network (or local connection... the name may differ slightly for you). if anything else is enabled, disable it. right click local area network and select properties. you\'re now looking for a new window to pop up that lists a bunch of internet-sounding words like network or qos. look for the item called internet protocol (tcp/ip). double click that.7. select manual ip, and enter 192.168.2.1008. the subnet mask will get filled out automatically. ignore the gateway. hit ok, you\'re finished.9. start up the belkin utility, and hit ""refresh"" if nothing shows up on the list of detected extenders. if you\'re lucky, you will see the extender show up, and you can now click ""web management"".10. if no items show up on the belkin utility\'s list, or an item does show up but the ""web management"" icon is unclickable, then repeat steps 6-9 but enter the ip address 192.168.1.100 instead. then the extender should show up.11. finally, once you are able to click ""web management"", it will bring you to a webpage that is very much like a router setup page. the details of what you need to do here can be found in instructional docs on the web elsewhere. the basic idea is that you want to copy pretty much everything over to be identical to what your router settings are. the only exception is possibly the ssid of the belkin extender. depending on your preference, you may want to choose a different name for it just so you can confirm that its really working later on.12. save those settings (there\'s a systems tab at the bottom of the web management panel that allows you to save the settings into a file as a backup).13. unplug the extender from the computer, unplug the power for the extender, and move the extender to wherever you want. plug the power back in.14. go back to steps 6-9. remove the manual ip configuration for your local area connection, and revert the panels back to the way they were (which is probably ""automatically obtain ip address""). hit ok. enable all your network connections if you disabled them in step 6.15. you should now be able to use your wireless connection to see the extender under its fresh new ssid. enjoy.a version of the above for those that are network-saavy:1. disconnect all wireless from your computer, then connect your computer directly to the extender as if it were a router. power up the extender.2. manually specify your computer\'s ip address to be 192.168.2.xxx with subnet mask 255.255.255.0. yes, i know this step is weird. i\'ll explain the reason for it in step#4.3. install the belkin network utility. its a simple executable. start it up. it\'s purpose is to scan for the extender, provided that your extender is directly wired to your computer (which we did in step 1).4. you should see your extender show up in the utility. if the extender does not show up or the ""web management"" button is greyed out, this is because your computer and the belkin extender are on different subnets. the belkin extender is usually shipped from the warehouse hardwired to the ip address 192.168.2.254. what??? when you plug your computer into the extender, you need to hardwire your computer to be on the same subnet so the stupid utility will work. hence, since the factory setting for the extender is 192.168.2.254, hardwiring your computer\'s ip to 192.168.2.100 will get the utility to connect to the extender. however, if for some awful reason your extender is hardwired to some other ip address (which is configurable once you get to step#5), you need to change your computer\'s ip address to have a value that matches the extender\'s new subnet. in other words, if the extender ip somehow changes to 192.168.5.254, you should change your computer ip address to 192.168.5.1005. once you click ""web management"" you can configure the extender via a browser window. replicate your router\'s settings here (they all need to match the original router\'s, with the exception of the extender\'s ssid).6. hit save, then unplug the extender\'s power cord and ethernet, and then move it to wherever you would like. power it up again.7. remove your computer\'s manual ip address. you\'re now officially done.*as a note, i had occasional connection problems when i had my belkin router & extender encryption set to wpa-psk. i just switched my encryption to wep and now it is fine. not everyone has this problem.up this review, if you found it useful. i want to see other people spared from the excessive pain the rest of us have already experienced!', u'this thing works awesome, the only reason its not a five star item is that the setup ""can"" be difficult.  the device has an auto setup but, if you want to ensure its your network that its connected to or if you need to set the repeater up to connect to your secure network then you need to connect to it manually.  i love the feature of being able to rename the ssid when you repeat it if so desired. it can be named the same as your original network with the same key for seem less point hopping or you can change the name for different areas of the house so you know which point your connected too.  i\'m going to quote the guy before me chovy and list the directions that he wrote out.  they worked perfectly, and took me less than 10 min to set up the extender.>>>>>""a version of the above for those that are network-saavy:1. disconnect all wireless from your computer, then connect your computer directly to the extender as if it were a router. power up the extender.2. manually specify your computer\'s ip address to be 192.168.2.xxx with subnet mask 255.255.255.0. yes, i know this step is weird. i\'ll explain the reason for it in step#4.3. install the belkin network utility. its a simple executable. start it up. it\'s purpose is to scan for the extender, provided that your extender is directly wired to your computer (which we did in step 1).4. you should see your extender show up in the utility. if the extender does not show up or the ""web management"" button is greyed out, this is because your computer and the belkin extender are on different subnets. the belkin extender is usually shipped from the warehouse hardwired to the ip address 192.168.2.254. what???

""a leading consumer magazine which accepts no advertising"" and, uh, rhymes with consumer reports lists lg in the same top tier as sony.minuses:the thin side profile is cool the first time you see it, but the high price is the lack of effective local dimming.  it\'s not as impressive as some full-array tvs.  i\'d much rather have a thicker profile and have a full array. plus, i\'m guessing that the thin profile is responsible for the relatively sparse input/output options.  form over function, unfortunately.  i don\'t spend a lot of time looking at my tv from the side, so it\'s not exactly mission critical if it\'s 1 or 1.5 inches thick.  i\'d much rather have better image quality, better speakers, and more input options.you\'ll sometimes notice faint horizontal lines if you have sunlight or light of a certain polarization bouncing off the screen.  this is with 3d *disabled* and glasses off.  it\'s not a big deal.4 hdmi inputs might be enough for some.  it\'s not enough for others.  blame the anorexic look!no s-vhs inputs.  yeah, these are a dying breed, but still useful at times for that old game console (is a wii old?) or dvd player.  i wouldn\'t pay extra for these, but i wouldn\'t mind if they were there.other observations:optical-only audio outputs.  this will work for people with modern receivers, but more options are usually welcome.  as a workaround, there is a variable headphone output which cuts out the tv\'s built-in speakers and can be used with a miniplug-to-rca cable.built-in speakers are decent, but nothing exceptional.  again, i blame the supermodel-thin profile.  not a big deal as anyone spending these kind of bucks on a tv would probably have at least a pair of decent speakers.conclusion:all in all, this is easily the best tv we\'ve owned so far.  it makes our samsung look like it was built by amateurs, and gives our previous sony lcd tv a run for the money.  vizio\'s comparable offering comes close, but the image processing options on this lg put it over the top.', u'we\'ve owned this for two months now and it\'s easily the best tv we\'ve used (including a vizio, sony, samsung, westinghouse, and sceptre.)pluses:image quality is excellent. vibrant, but reasonable color, good default settings, solid contrast. i\'m still waiting for oled tvs, but this is very good.the best image processing options on any tv. hook up your set-top, laptop, or other computer via hdmi, hit q.menu on the remote, and then choose one of the bottom 2 ""expert"" image modes. as far as i can tell, this is the only line of tvs that allow you to totally disable sharpening when set to 50. in expert mode, you can even adjust settings for vertical and horizontal processing. my head asplod. sony and samsung can disable sharpening, but they incorrectly display text, so you\'ll get red and blue fringing on text that has cleartype enabled over hdmi. i guess they expect you to use the rgb input, but why would you want to and lose the pure digital connection + audio?

B00HZWOQZ6,"[u'traveling is usually a rough experience when you are on the road. this leads to a frustrating experience when you are in a hotel with ""internet"" but can\'t connect to it because the connection is wired. thankfully hootoo has made the  hootoo tripmate nano wireless n pocket travel router as not only a means to connect to internet, but as an electronic jackknife for the traveling man.inside the packaging is the hootoo tripmate nano, a micro usb cable, and a user manual. my first impression of this device is that it is very small. i can\'t believe a device this small is able to do so many things at one time. i like the simple construction of the device, and that it doesn\'t attract fingerprints.the included micro usb cable is 18 inches long, which isn\'t very long, but the purpose of the cable is to just charge the tripmate. the gauge of the wire isn\'t thick or thin. i like that this device uses micro usb to power the router because this cable is easily accessible from any electronic store if it were to ever be damaged, lost, or stolen.as said before, the device is very small (2.2 x 0.6 x 2 inches) and light (3.2 ounces). the top face of the device has the hootoo logo, a wan symbol with a blue led, and a wi-fi with a green led (statuses below).wi-fi led:blinking green: system loadingsolid green: system loadedwan led:solid blue: tripmate is connected to the

your computer.if you are going to setup this from your mobile device:1. download the ""ho0too tripmate"" app from the google play store.2. then make sure the tripmate micro usb port is connected to a powered usb device.3. connect to the network name ""tripmatenano-xxxx"" with password ""11111111"" (8 x 1\'s)4. run the ""hootoo tripmate"" app.5. tab on ""my tripmate"" from here you should be able to setup and connect your device to the internet.if you are going to setup by your computer:1. connect to network ""tripmatenano-xxxx"" with password ""11111111"" (8 x 1\'s)2. when you are connected, enter into your web browser ""10.10.10.254""3. from here, you will be asked if you want to change the router settings password, and if you want to connect this router to a wireless network.from here you will decide if you want to continue to use this as a ""wired"" connection or ""wireless connection."" if you are using this as a router, and have this connected to an ethernet connection, then you will to continue to use this as a wired connection. if you want to use this as a wireless extender and want to stream content from the usb, then you will switch to the ""wireless"" connection. i

gb, flash drive usb 3.0to mysharkk bus-powered usb 3.0 4-port compact hubwhich was connected to the usb port. each usb device was able to successfully connect individually to the usb port but the usb 3.0 card reader, which couldn\'t connect until the hub was connected. i was amazed that this small router which was connected to a 2.1a power supply could successfully power and use an entire 3.0 usb hub and read the data off of each item.i then entered the 10.10.10.254 address and was successfully able to access the contents on each of these storage devices. however, all of the contents was read under the main folder ""usbdisk1_volume1"". this may or may not be a good thing, as the content of the storage devices would be merged into this one folder. content from the website 10.10.10.254 can be downloaded, but not streamed, which is inconvenient to web users. the content can, however, be streamed to media devices as a nas file server.nas file server:although the main hootoo app can be used, i prefer to use the android app ""es file explorer"" when using this as a nas file server for streaming video content from my storage devices.setting your nas file server is very simple.1. connect to the ""tripmatenano-xxxx"" network.2. open the ""network"" tab, and then on the ""lan"" sub-tab.3. tap on ""scan"" with the search icon.4. you should see ""10.10.10.254"" in the available lan networks, if not tap ""new""5. hold tap on ""10.10.10.254"" and then tap ""edit serer""6. enter the following detailsdomain: (leave empty)server: 10.10.10.254username: admin (or whatever you chose as the username)password: (blank or whatever you chose as the password)display as: 10.10.10.254 (or whatever name you want to choose)from here you should be able to enter ""usbdisk1_volume1"" and any video content that you wish to choose. note that it should be recommended that you download a video app such as ""bs player"" as the default android player does lag. also, if you are using the apple version of this app then know that apple devices cannot decipher some video codecs.also note that this content can be viewed online or offline. the tripmate emits a wireless signal, whether or not a wireless connection is enabled.wi-fi hotspot:you are able to setup this device as a wi-fi hotspot, or range extender, by setting the switch to the wireless setting. from here you can connect this router to an existing wireless connection. you will still be under the ""tripmatenano-xxxx"" wireless network, but able to use the internet and access any media connected to the router.during my tests, i was able to receive the follow speeds with the tripmate in wireless mode:upload: 8mb/sdownload: 1mb/si was able to receive the receive the following results from my main wireless internet connection:upload 8mb/sdownload: 1mb/si was able to receive the same speeds from the tripmate as i did from my own wireless router. these are excellent results for this device.wireless extender:this device can also be used as a wireless extender. simply log into the website 10.10.10.254 and then go to the tab ""network"". from you would be able to change the default ""tripmatenano-xxxx"" to the name and password of your existing ssid.so, if my ssid and password were:ssid: yournetworkinfoherepassword: yourpasswordherethen i would change the default settings of the tripmate to:ssid: yournetworkinfoherepassword: yourpasswordhereafter the two minutes to restart the device, it will successfully be turned into a wireless extender. however, you will not be able to access the 10.10.10.254 website until you do a factory reset on the device.final thoughts:overall, i extremely like all of the features of this small device. i would be able to go on a road trip with a bunch of friends and be able for each of us to be streaming different content to each of our mobile devices simultaneously. because of the compactness of this device, it is the perfect electronic swiss army knife, as long as a power supply is attached. it is also good to use as a router or wireless extender if i were to ever require internet from a hotel\'s wired connection. i would extremely recommend this device to anyone whom needs a multifunctional device when traveling, and is why i give it 5 out of 5 stars.pros:+ price is great for being a router, range extender, wireless media server, or nas file server.+ able to use under wired or wireless connection.+ able to successfully connect a 4-port usb hub that is connected to an external hard drive, card reader, and flash drive.+ mobile devices can view streamed content from the tripmate, online or offline.+ very easy to setup compared to competition.+ very portable and light device.+ a simplistic design that doesn\'t attract finger prints.+ bottom of tripmate has default settings information.+ uses micro usb to power the device; a common cable that is easily accessible from any electronic store.cons:- although i was able to read all of the contents of the three storage devices that was connected to the usb hub, the content was all read under the main folder ""usbdisk1_volume1"". if the content of your storage devices have similar folders, then the folders will be merged.- not able to stream videos from website. content has to be downloaded from the website, or the content has to be viewed from your mobile device.- requires a power supply, as the device contains no battery.i was provided a sample in exchange for an honest and thorough review.', u""at first when i received this wonderful little device and started reading the booklet that came with it i was like &#34;really? &#34; this is going to do all of these amazing things. no way! but when i got into testing it out it did do everything and more.it's the best way to  connect the internet while you're on the road. the setup can be a bit tricky but not anything that a novice can't figure out. if i can do it anyone can. so i'm going to say..yes it's that easy. some said it's tricky but that's only if you're in a rush and don't read the full instructions.here's some of the specs i got off the box itself;the bottom has a typo, as it is spelled steup instead of &#34;setup&#34;. also, the password is (8 x 1's).specifications:* cpu model/frequency: ralink rt5350/mips245kec 360mhz* wi-fi: 802.11b/g/n, 2.4ghz* speed: 720mbps for 20mhz, 150mbps for 40mhz* wan

mobile device or your computer.if you are going to setup this from your mobile device:1. download the &#34;ho0too tripmate&#34; app from the google play store.2. then make sure the tripmate micro usb port is connected to a powered usb device.3. connect to the network name &#34;tripmatenano-xxxx&#34; with password &#34;11111111&#34; (8 x 1's)4. run the &#34;hootoo tripmate&#34; app.5. tab on

and if you want to connect this router to a wireless network.from here you will decide if you want to continue to use this as a &#34;wired&#34; connection or &#34;wireless connection.&#34; if you are using this as a router, and have this connected to an ethernet connection, then you will to continue to use this as a wired connection. if you want to use this as a wireless extender and want to stream content from the usb, then you will switch to the &#34;wireless&#34; connection. i personally prefer this router over the ravpower filehub as this device was easier to setup and is able to be

own wireless router put out. not so..it was identical. that said i'm totally sold.wireless extender:this device can also be used as a wireless extender. just follow the directions.i'm so impressed with this little device that i'm already thinking about ordering one more for my college bound daughter. afterall she'll be on the road a lot more then myself and hubby!don't let this size fool you. for a little itty bitty item it really packs a punch.i was given a sample of this item in exchange for my honest review of this product.""]"
